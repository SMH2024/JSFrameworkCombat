# framework-kombat
Inspired by the eternal battle and discussion about “which front end framework is the best”, I wanted to try to create a small combat style browser game, done with Vue.js (still Vue 2 back when I started working on this, and some help from Vuex for state management) as a single page application. My motivation for this was purely to have fun with it and have a change from the usual apps I develop for work projects.

You can checkout the game [here.](https://jscombat.azureedge.net/#/home)
Give it a try, have your front end framework of choice battle against other frameworks and see who is better.
